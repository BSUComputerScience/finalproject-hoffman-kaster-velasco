## General Info
***
We strive to create an application that can easily assist new and experienced players of 
Magic: The Gathering by giving them information on what a specific card does, its attributes, 
real world cost, and resources to purchase said card. This Application will take a user inputted
card, checks to see if there is a card with that name, and will return the info of the card,
like name, mana cost, type of card it is, the rarity, description, power, toughness, and color of the card.
If the inputted card name is not correctly spelled or is missing some parts of the name, the application will
match it with what they think you were trying to enter.
